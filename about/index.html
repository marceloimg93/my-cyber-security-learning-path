  <p>I&rsquo;ve been working on IT since 2017. Back than, I started maintaing Linux server in production environments and managing/troubleshooting network;</p>
<p>My school was running an infrastructure with 3COM switches connected through Optical Fibers and running VMs on a old IBM x3650 M3 (BTW, this old server is now my HomeLab&hellip; lol). I had to reconstruct the whole network infrastructure using VLANs for accessing controls for different devices/people and everything was managed through a virtual Router/Firewall; Yes, I know&hellip; there is a better and modern way to do it;</p>
<p>While working as infrastructure manager, I started my learning path into software development and that&rsquo;s when I got the opportunity to built two systems from scratch that were actually used for production environment. One that I&rsquo;m most proud of, is an event mangement software that was used to manage subscriptions, goods consumptions and financing transactions from participants. Because it had financing transactions involved, I had to manage in order to make the system highly available and consistent. We had a peak of 10k requests in last than 6 minutes and almost 1 million BRL (Brazilian money) financial transactions. I can&rsquo;t figure it out a better school than this. The system was running in a hibrid cloud/on-premise environment, the reason why we had to keep it redundance is that the phisical location where the events used to happen had Internet connective issues so we couldn&rsquo;t count on system running only on Cloud. All this was achieve by using the stack: Angular 2, NodeJS, MySQL, Docker, Ubuntu Linux, AWS and XenServer for hypervisioning.</p>
<p>If I can defined my carreer in simple words, it would be: &ldquo;one man army&rdquo; - not that I know everything or I&rsquo;m good enought&hellip; but I always had to win a battle by my self and that gave me the opportunity to understand that it is not about knowing everything but know how to get dig for the information you need to fix a problem; The most I love about this definition is that it gave me the opportunity to visualize a web application working from end to end; Starting from the moment that a user request a page and clicks a button in the browser until it reaches the server and the whole infrastructure that runs behind the scenes to return a resource to the client.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I decided to learn Cyber Security, because it is awesome to see the entire process and figure it out how to break a system, explore a vulnerability and, most important, how to make it secure! This blog is about keep tracking of what I&rsquo;ve learned, what were the challenges and how did I figure it out; Hopefully, this can be helpfull for someone else who decided to join the force and learning Cyber Security. ^^</p>
<p>For future record, the starting date for this blog is <strong>2022-03-09</strong></p>
